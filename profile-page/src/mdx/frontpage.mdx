{<PublicationCard title="Elimination of Reflections in Laser Scanner Systems by using Convolutional Neural Networks" image={MicPaperImage} project_link="/mic-paper" journal="MIC Journal" journal_link="https://www.mic-journal.no/ABS/MIC-2022-1-2.asp/">
    <p>This paper presents a machine learning approach for eliminating reflections in line laser scanning of
aluminium workpieces to be welded. The elimination of reflections is important to obtain accurate laser
scanning of workpiece geometry for highly reflective materials like aluminium. The proposed solution is
to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained to eliminate the reflections. </p>
