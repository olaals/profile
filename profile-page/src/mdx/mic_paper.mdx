### Abstract
This paper presents a machine learning approach for eliminating reflections in line laser scanning of
aluminium workpieces to be welded. The elimination of reflections is important to obtain accurate laser
scanning of workpiece geometry for highly reflective materials like aluminium. The proposed solution is
to use a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is trained to eliminate the reflections. The training
of the network is done by simulating the laser line of the scanner in ray-tracing software using aluminium
surfaces with appropriate reflection properties. This CNN then recovers the reflected laser line by removing
the reflections. The CNN is used with two different camera configurations. In the first configuration one
camera and one laser scanner are used. In the second configuration two cameras are used in a stereo
arrangement in combination with the line laser. In this case, the planar homography of the laser plane
is used to detect possible points on the laser line in a preprocessing step. The high performance of the
solution is demonstrated for simulated data.
